While shopping for a house, the budget is one of the biggest deciding factors. So, I was looking for an amortization calculator that could help me budget the typical pieces of a mortgage: P&I, taxes, insurance, but also calculate extra payments.

So I made my own.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
